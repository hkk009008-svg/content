## Spec reviewer prompt template

```
You are reviewing whether Task <N>'s implementation matches its spec.
**Do NOT trust the implementer's report** — read the actual code.

## What Was Requested

<paste exact requirements + numbered checklist of behaviors>

## What Implementer Claims

<list claims to be verified, including commit SHA>

## Your Job

1. `git show <SHA> -- <file>` — read the diff
2. Verify each requirement above
3. Look for: missing requirements, extra unrequested features, misunderstandings
4. <task-specific verification commands>

## Report

- ✅ Spec compliant
- ❌ Issues — list with file:line refs

Under <N> words.
```

## Code quality reviewer prompt template

```
Code quality review for Task <N> (commit `<SHA>`).

**WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED:** <one-paragraph summary>
**PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS:** <reference to plan section>
**BASE_SHA:** `<sha>`
**HEAD_SHA:** `<sha>`
**DESCRIPTION:** <one-paragraph context>

**Working directory:** `<absolute>`
**Diff command:** `git diff <BASE>..<HEAD> -- <files>`

In addition to standard concerns, check:
- <task-specific concern 1> (e.g., concurrency if threading is involved)
- <task-specific concern 2> (e.g., public API stability if refactor)

Report: Strengths, Issues (Critical / Important / Minor), Assessment.
Under <N> words.
